# gifv-downloader
I recently have had trouble with the GIFV-container. While it may be nice for web applications, it's terrible for offline viewing, as it's essentially just a wrapped link to a hosted gif or mp4 (at least when downloaded from, for example, Reddit). With this script, bulk-downloading of gifv files in either .gif or .mp4 from a folder is easy (for example downloads of reddit posts embeds)

Usage: Run in any folder containing .gifv files
