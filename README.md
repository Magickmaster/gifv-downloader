# gifv-downloader
I recently have had trouble with the GIFV-container. While it may be nice for web applications, it's terrible for offline viewing. With this script, bulk-downloading of gifv files in either .gif or .mp4 from a folder is easy (for example downloads of reddit posts embeds)

Usage: Run in any folder containing .gifv files
